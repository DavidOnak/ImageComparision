<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Consistent Measurement Standards</span></strong></p>
<div class="c_content">

	<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Whether you are a research biologist, a steward of salmon habitat, or just interested in Pacific salmon, we want to enable the integration of different sources of Pacific salmon information. Within DFO we use a variety of measurement and reporting scales which can make using different data sets together difficult. Interoperability is a priority in the development of the portal. Our goal is to ensure all data that is displayed on the portal can be cross-referenced and we will achieve this by standardizing the units used.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Salmon Population Units</strong></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Pacific salmon represent an incredibly diverse species in terms of their ecology, appearance, and behavior. They are the most ecologically diverse vertebrate species in Canada, with many thousands of more or less distinctive &ldquo;populations&rdquo;. Combining these populations into larger genetically-diverse groups serve both as a useful management and research tool.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">For instance, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) introduced the concept of &ldquo;Conservation Units&rdquo;, or CUs, which serve as both fundamental units of biodiversity and the accounting units for documenting progress in achieving the policy goals of WSP.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Meanwhile, fisheries-related revisions to the Fishery Act required the use of &ldquo;Stock Management Units&rdquo;, or SMUs, which are a group of one or more CUs that are managed together with the objective of achieving an aggregate for harvest planning and reporting purposes.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Both images above show the South Coast Area region with the left showing the Coho SMUs and the right showing the Chum SMUs. Though the area they cover is the same, the boundaries of the SMUs vary between species. Move the slider left and right to see the differences.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the key outcomes that the Pacific Salmon Data Portal hopes to achieve is to make key Pacific salmon data interoperable for analysis and reporting at a common scale. This initiative aims to bolster conservation, restoration and stewardship efforts. While Pacific salmon population units hold significance in salmon conservation, we recognize that they are not the sole standard we need to adopt. We&rsquo;re open to considering other essential measurement units and standards.</span></p>
